    "# Hyperparameter Tuning with Katib\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning is the process of optimizing a model's hyperparameter values in order to maximize the predictive quality of the model.\n",
    "Examples of such hyperparameters are the learning rate, neural architecture depth (layers) and width (nodes), epochs, batch size, dropout rate, and activation functions.\n",
    "These are the parameters that are set prior to training; unlike the model parameters (weights and biases), these do not change during the process of training the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Katib](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib) automates the process of hyperparameter tuning by running a pre-configured number of training jobs (known as **trials**) in parallel.\n",
    "Each trial evaluates a different set of hyperparameter configurations.\n",
    "Within each **experiment** it automatically adjusts the hyperparameters to find their optimal values with regard to the objective function, which is typically the model's metric (e.g. accuracy, AUC, F1, precision).\n",
    "An experiment therefore consists of an objective, a search space for the hyperparameters, and a [search algorithm](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib#hyperparameter-tuning).\n",
    "At the end of the experiment, Katib outputs the optimized values, which are also known as **suggestions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    <b>Three Data Sets</b><br>Whereas it is common to have training and test data sets in traditional (supervised) machine learning, in deep learning (esp. when combined with hyperparameter tuning), it is recommended to have a three-way split: training, validation (a.k.a. as development), and test. \n",
    "    The training data set is, as always, to learn parameters (weights and biases) from data. \n",
    "    The test data set is also known as the hold-out set and its sole purpose is to check the model's hypothesis of parameter values in terms of how well it generalizes to data it has never come across.\n",
    "    The point of the validation data set is to cross-validate the model and tweak the hyperparameters. \n",
    "    Since information from this data set is used to adjust the model, it is not an objective test of the model's generalizability. \n",
    "    It is not unlike a <a href=\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6424581736302284800-Kdas\\\">teacher checking up on students</a>:\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "      <li>The training data set is the text book to learn the theory from</li>\n",
    "      <li>The validation data set comprises the exercises to practice the theory</li>\n",
    "      <li>The test data set is exam to assess the degree of learning vs lookup</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "This notebook shows how you can create and configure an `Experiment` for both `TensorFlow` and `PyTorch` training jobs.\n",
    "In terms of Kubernetes, such an experiment is a custom resource handled by the Katib operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Need\n",
    "A Docker image with either a [TensorFlow](../training/tensorflow/MNIST%20with%20TensorFlow.ipynb) or [PyTorch](../training/pytorch/MNIST%20with%20PyTorch.ipynb) model that accepts hyperparameters as arguments.\n",
    "Please click on the links to see such models.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it, so let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Specify Hyperparameters in Your Models\n",
    "In order for Katib to be able to tweak hyperparameters it needs to know what these are called in the model.\n",
    "Beyond that, the model must specify these hyperparameters either as regular (command line) parameters or as environment variables.\n",
    "Since the model needs to be containerized, any command line parameters or environment variables must to be passed to the container that holds your model.\n",
    "By far the most common and also the recommended way is to use command line parameters that are captured with [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) or similar; the trainer (function) then uses their values internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Expose Model Metrics as Objective Functions\n",
    "By default, Katib collects metrics from the standard output of a job container by using a sidecar container.\n",
    "In order to make the metrics available to Katib, they must be logged to [stdout](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/hyperparameter-tuning/experiment/#metrics-collector) in the `key=value` format.\n",
    "The job output will be redirected to `/var/log/katib/metrics.log` file.\n",
    "This means that the objective function (for Katib) must match the metric's `key` in the models output.\n",
    "It's therefore possible to define custom model metrics for your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    <b>Sidecars</b><br>\n",
    "    In the sidecar (a.k.a. sidekick or decomposition) pattern, if you are not already familiar with it, a secondary (sidecar) container is attached to the primary workload inside a pod in Kubernetes. In many cases, pods run a single container, but peripheral services, such as networking services, monitoring, and logging, are required in all applications and services. With sidecars there is no need to re-implement basic but secondary tasks in each service or application. The sidecar has the same lifecycle as the primary application and it has access to the same resources. The sidecar is, however, isolated from the main container, which means it does not have to be implemented in the same technology. This means it can easily be reused across various workloads.<br><br>\n",
    "    Katib does not care whether you use TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, or any other framework for that matter. All it needs to do its job is a (parameterized) trainer container and the logs to grab the model's metrics from.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Create Experiments\n",
    "Before we proceed, let's set up a few basic definitions that we can re-use.\n",
    "Note that you typically use (YAML) resource definitions for Kubernetes from the command line, but we shall show you how to do everything from a notebook, so that you do not have to exit your favourite environment at all!\n",
    "Of course, if you are more familiar or comfortable with `kubectl` and the command line, feel free to use a local CLI or the embedded terminals from the Jupyter Lab launch screen."
