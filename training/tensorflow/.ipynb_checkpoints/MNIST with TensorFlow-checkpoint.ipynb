    "## Introduction\n",
    "Recognizing handwritten digits based on the [MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) data set](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is the \"Hello, World\" example of machine learning.\n",
    "Each (anti-aliased) black-and-white image represents a digit from 0 to 9 and has been fit into a 28x28 pixel bounding box.\n",
    "The problem of recognizing digits from handwriting is, for instance, important to the postal service when automatically reading zip codes from envelopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "We'll show you how to use TensorFlow to build a model with a convolutional layer and a fully connected layer to perform the multi-class classification of images provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example in the notebook includes both training a model in the notebook and running a [distributed](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training) `TFJob` on the cluster, so you can easily scale up your own models.\n",
    "For the distributed training job you'll need to package the complete trainer code in a Docker image.\n",
    "We'll show you how to do that with Kubeflow Fairing, so that you do not have to leave your favourite notebook environment at all!\n",
    "We'll also include instructions for local development, in case you prefer that.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",

    "    <code>TFJob</code> is a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/\">custom resource (definition) (CRD)</a> provided by the <a href=\"https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/reference/tfjob/v1/tensorflow/\">TensorFlow operator</a>.\n",
    "    <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/\">Operators</a> extend Kubernetes by capturing domain-specific knowledge on how to deploy and run an application or service, how to deal with failures, and so on.\n",
    "    The lifecycle of a <code>TFJob</code> is managed by the TensorFlow operator controller.\n",
    "    A distributed TensorFlow job typically consists of the following processes:\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li>The <b>chief</b> ('master') is responsible for orchestrating the training and performing supplementary tasks, such as initializing the graph, checkpointing, and, saving logs for TensorBoard, and saving the model. It also manages failures and restarts. If the chief itself fails, the training is restarted from the last available checkpoint.</li>\n",
    "        <li>The <b>workers</b>, as you might expect, do the actual work of training the model. In certain configurations, worker 0 may also act as the chief.</li>\n",
    "        <li><b>Parameter servers</b> (ps) provide a distributed data store for the model parameters.</li>\n",
    "        <li>An <b>Evaluator</b> is used to compute evaluation metrics.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    The TensorFlow operator <a href=\"https://github.com/kubeflow/tf-operator/blob/master/tf_job_design_doc.md#controller\">controller</a> takes care of the <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training#TF_CONFIG\"><code>TF_CONFIG</code></a> environment variable, which is required for distributed training.\n",

    "### What You'll Need\n",
    "All you need is this notebook.\n",
    "If you prefer to create your Docker image locally (i.e. outside of the Kubernetes cluster), you must have a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/container-runtime) client on your machine and configured to work with your own container registry.\n",
    "For Kubernetes commands to be run outside of the cluster, [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/) is required.\n",

    "    A series of convolutional kernels (of the same dimensions) is applied to the image to obtain different versions of the same base image (i.e. filters).\n",
    "    These filters extract patterns hierarchically.\n",
    "    In the first layer, filters typically capture dots, edges, corners, and so on.\n",
    "    With each additional layer, these patterns become more complex and turn from basic geometric shapes into constituents of objects and entire objects.\n",
    "    That is why often the number of filters increases with each additional convolutional layer: to extract more complex patterns.<br><br>\n",
    "    Convolutional layers are often followed by a pooling layer to down-sample the input.\n",
    "    This aids in lowering the computational burden as we increase the number of filters.\n",
    "    A max pooling layer simply picks the largest value of pixels in a small (rectangular) neighbourhood of a single channel (e.g. RGB). \n",
    "    This has the effect of making features <em>locally</em> translation-invariant, which is often desired: whether a feature of interest is on the left or right edge of a pooling window, which is also referred to as a kernel, is largely irrelevant to the problem of image classification.\n",
    "    Note that this may not always be a desired characteristic and depends on the size of the pooling kernel.\n",
    "    For instance, the precice location of tissue damage in living organisms or defects on manufactured products may be very significant indeed.\n",
    "    Pooling kernels are generally chosen to be relatively small compared to the dimensions of the input, which means that local translation invariance is often desired. <br><br>\n",
    "    Another common component of CNNs is a dropout layer.\n",
    "    <a href=\"http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html\">Dropout</a> provides a mechanism for regularization that has proven successful in many applications.\n",
    "    It is suprisingly simple: some nodes' weights (and biases) in a specific layer are set to zero <em>at random</em>, that is, arbitrary nodes are removed from the network during the training step.\n",
    "    This causes the network to not rely on any single node (a.k.a. neuron) for a feature, as each node can be dropped at random.\n",
    "    The network therefore has to learn redundant representations of features.\n",
    "    This is important because of what is referred to as <em>internal covariate shift</em> (often mentioned in connection with <a href=\"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/ioffe15.html\">batch normalization</a>): the change of distributions of internal nodes' weights due to all other layers, which can cause nodes to stop learning (i.e. updating their weights).\n",
    "    Thanks to dropout, layers become more robust to changes, although it also means it limits what can be learnt (as always with regularization).\n",
    "    Still, dropout is the neural network's equivalent of the saying you should never put all your eggs in one basket.\n",
    "    Layers with a high risk of overfitting (e.g. layers with many units and lots of inputs) typically have a higher dropout rate.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    A nice visual explanation of convolutional layers is available <a href=\"https://cezannec.github.io/Convolutional_Neural_Networks/\">here</a>.\n",
    "    If you're curious what a CNN \"sees\" while training, you can have a look <a href=\"https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/\">here</a>.\n",
